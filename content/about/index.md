*This is my personal blog. The views expressed on these pages are mine alone and not those of my employer.*

I'm a game dev working at [Supercell](https://supercell.com/) in the engine team.
On my free time I write about indie mobile games that are either forgotten or never discovered, play quite some game, and even try to make some even if many stop at a very early proto stage.

I also love graphics programming. Years ago I co-founded [opengl-tutorial.org](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org).
