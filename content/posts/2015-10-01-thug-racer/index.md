*Thug Racer* bring [*Out Run*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run) on mobile! Driving a sport car, escaping the cops, time limit ... One really cool indie game with retro graphics!<!--more-->

As many good game it's easy to learn and hard to master. Super simple controls: turn left, turn right and brake. An easy goal: complete 5 stages as quickly as possible. But completing that goal require a lot of practise and skills to avoid other cars, escape police patrols and avoid crashing in the walls.

Monetisation is really good: you can play the game in arcade mode (the main one) for free,with some ads from time to time at the end of a run. You can also do a one time purchase to get a new golden skin on your car, get access to the endless mode, remove the ads, and also help an indie!

Thug Racer is made by [Super Coockie Games](http://www.supercookie.co.uk/), two indie game developers from London: [Dan](https://twitter.com/spectrumzx128k) and [James](https://twitter.com/MonsterofCookie).
