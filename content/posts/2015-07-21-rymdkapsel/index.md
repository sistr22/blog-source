*Rymdkapsel* took the essence realtime strategy (RTS) games and released it in a unique and pure experience.<!--more-->

If you know about RTS you can hardly imagine be playing one on mobile given the amount of actions you have to do every seconds. Well Rymdkapsel succeed surprisingly well at removing the low level management to let you handle only the high level decisions. You decide the layout of your space station, the amount of minions in each kind of "job", and then watch them working, adjusting your orders and adding new ones on the fly. You build the layout of your station by assembling rooms with different purpose. Each of this room have the shape of a tetris block which make it increasingly difficult to build an optimal station.

As the gameplay, the art style is minimalist. It is relaxing and the design help you focus on what matters: taking decisions quickly, and reading easily what is happening in your station. Regarding the lenght of the game, Rymdkapsel offer 3 different modes: the normal mode, a harder mode called "Plus" and a "Zen" mode without enemies where you just play at your own pace. It also offer some achievements, and a leaderboard to compete for the longest resistance time.

[Grapefrukt Games](http://grapefrukt.com/) is the Sweden studio behind this mobile game. It consist of exactly one guy: [Martin Jonasson](https://twitter.com/grapefrukt/). Finally Rymdkapsel is a premium title: no ads, no in app purchase, no hidden cost !
